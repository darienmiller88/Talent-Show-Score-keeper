# Talent Show Score Keeper

Similar to my jeopardy score keeper, 

Here are the following changes I plan on making:

- For the front end, I will replace Vue with HTMX, Alpine.js and SCSS. On paper, this means I will sacrifice heavy front end tooling for a massively simplified workflow that aligns well the simple styling of the score keeper. Alpine will replace front end state management and non-server updates.

- For the back end, I will stick with go, but instead of it serving JSON to seperate front end, it will instead serve HTML fragments and HTMX pages instead. The HTMX will make request to end points on the server, receive fragments, and place them onto the HTMX page directly. Game state will be saved in a redis cache rather than in local storage to ensure the names of players aren't exposed, and that point incrementing and decrementing are near instant.

### New Tech Stack:
* [HTMX](https://htmx.org/)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/)
* [Redis](https://redis.io/)
* [Go](https://go.dev/)
* [go-chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi)
* [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
* [Railway](https://railway.com)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Features
This version will still retain the following features from v1:

* Single player Jeopardy. Client can add and remove Users to a specific ADAPT location, and add and subtract points to them.
* Tournament/Team jeopardy mode where the client can choose the host location for the game, and which teams are playing.
* The ability to save games, both single player and team jeopardy.
* Viewing games, which will include the winner of the game, and the total and average amount of points earned during the game.

### Requirements:

* Clone repo using `git clone https://github.com/darienmiller88/JeopardyScoreBoard-V2`
* Migrate the necessary information to your local `.env` as described in the `.env_sample` file
* Install the Go migrate CLI tool:
  * **Windows (using Scoop):** `scoop install migrate`
  * **macOS (using Homebrew):** `brew install golang-migrate`
  * **Linux:** Download from [releases](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/releases) or use `curl -L https://packagecloud.io/golang-migrate/migrate/gpgkey | apt-key add - && apt-get update && apt-get install -y migrate`
* Run database migrations: `migrate -path ./migrations -database "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/dbname?sslmode=disable" up`
  * Replace connection string values with those from your `.env` file
* Run go build to create a root level `JeopardyScoreBoardV2.exe` file, and then run `.\JeopardyScoreBoard-V2` to run the executable. If an executable is not needed, simply input `go run main.go` instead, or `.\fresh` to enable a server restart on change.
